# 3 minute quickstart guide

This short guide will have you downloading and installing Unison and running your first program (a toy distributed mergesort implementation). There isn't much exposititon here and the focus here is on getting you up and running as quickly as possible. üèé 

More in-depth guides follow this one.

If you have any trouble with the process or ideas about how to improve this document, [come talk to us in Slack][slack]! Also this document is [on GitHub][on-github].

### Step 1: Download Unison

Download the `unison` executable for [Mac][mac-dl], [Linux][linux-dl], or [Windows][windows-dl] and then (optional) add it to your path.

### Step 2: Create your Unison codebase

Create a new directory, `unisoncode` (or any name you choose), then run the `unison` binary from within that directory. You'll see a note about "No codebase exists here so I'm initializing one..." and a welcome screen.

<script id="asciicast-IYWfFwIgyl9Gilk3ZExvLfOjg" src="https://asciinema.org/a/IYWfFwIgyl9Gilk3ZExvLfOjg.js" data-speed="2" data-cols="65" async></script>

### Step 3: Fetch and run a distributed mergesort example

Prerequisites for this step: you'll need to have Git installed and on your path. At the Unison `.>` prompt, do:

```
.> pull https://github.com/unisonweb/unisonbase.git
``` 

to fetch a base library with the example you'll be running. You'll see some output from `git` in the background, and once that's done you can do `edit quickstart.dsort` to add the `dsort` distributed mergesort function to the top of a newly created _scratch file_, `scratch.u`:

<script id="asciicast-o9lfrfetnmUT4ArqdDFMXZkr9" src="https://asciinema.org/a/o9lfrfetnmUT4ArqdDFMXZkr9.js" data-speed="2" data-rows="30" data-cols="65" async></script>

Open that file and add the following _watch expression_ (a line starting with `>`) to the top, then save the file:

```
> runLocal '(quickstart.dsort (<) [8,2,3,1,4,5,6,7])
```

<script id="asciicast-aTn8qIa3DHaxhspsZJmXodfO7" src="https://asciinema.org/a/aTn8qIa3DHaxhspsZJmXodfO7.js" data-speed="2" async></script>

You should see your watch expression evaluate to a sorted list.  _Disclaimer:_ This example is just a toy that simulates execution locally and does no error handling, but it shows the general idea of being able to test Unison distributed programs locally (perhaps with simulated latency and failures injected) and then run the same programs unchanged atop an actual elastic source of distributed compute!

### What next?

* Come [say hello in Slack][slack], tell us what you thought about this guide, and ask questions. üëã
* A [more leisurely guide][guide] to the Unison language and the `unison` command line tool. (25 minutes)
